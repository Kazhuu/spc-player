# SPC Player

Arduino based SNES SPC file music player with the original SNES hardware.

This project is heavily based on these two projects:
https://github.com/emukidid/SNES_APU_SD and
https://www.caitsith2.com/snes/apu.htm.

## TODO

* Can play some songs but not all because of the fixed boot code location.
* Uploading RAM takes really long, try to see for bottlenecks and remove them.
* Comment code with Doxygen when cleaned up.
* Add description of the project to this repository.
